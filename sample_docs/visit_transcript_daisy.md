## History and Physical Examination

**Dr. Sarah Chen:** Good morning, Alex. I see Daisy is here today. What's been going on?

**Alex Morgan:** Hi Dr. Chen. Daisy started vomiting two days ago. It's been happening a few times a day, and she's just not herself. She's been really lethargic and hasn't been eating much. Normally she's very food-motivated, so that's really unusual for her.

**Dr. Chen:** I understand your concern. Let me examine Daisy. [Performs physical examination] Daisy's temperature is normal at 101.2°F. Her heart rate is slightly elevated, and I notice her gums are a bit tacky, which suggests some dehydration. Her abdomen is soft but she seems uncomfortable when I palpate it. She's lost a little weight since her last visit.

**Alex Morgan:** Is it serious? What could be causing this?

**Dr. Chen:** There are several possibilities. Given the vomiting, lethargy, and decreased appetite, we're looking at potential causes like gastrointestinal upset, dehydration, or possibly something more systemic. The dehydration is a concern - that's why her gums feel tacky. I'd like to run some diagnostic tests to get a clearer picture.

## Diagnostic Plan

**Dr. Chen:** I recommend we do a complete blood count (CBC) and a chemistry panel. The CBC will tell us about her white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. The chemistry panel will check her kidney function, liver enzymes, and electrolyte levels. This will help us understand if there's an infection, inflammation, or organ dysfunction.

**Alex Morgan:** That sounds good. Whatever you think is best.

**Dr. Chen:** We'll draw the blood samples now and have results back in a couple of hours. In the meantime, I want to make sure Daisy stays hydrated. Have you noticed if she's been drinking water?

**Alex Morgan:** She's been drinking some, but not as much as usual.

**Dr. Chen:** That's consistent with what I'm seeing. Let's get those tests done, and I'll call you with the results this afternoon.

## Test Results Discussion (Phone Call - Later Same Day)

**Dr. Chen:** Hi Alex, I have Daisy's lab results back. There are a few things I'd like to discuss.

**Alex Morgan:** Okay, what did you find?

**Dr. Chen:** The good news is that Daisy's red blood cell count and hemoglobin are within normal ranges, so she's not anemic. However, I did see some abnormalities:

First, her white blood cell count is elevated, and specifically her neutrophils are high. This suggests there's some inflammation or possible infection going on.

Second, and this is the more significant finding, her kidney values are elevated. Her BUN (blood urea nitrogen) is 32, which is above normal, and her creatinine is 1.8, also elevated. These are markers of kidney function, and the elevation could indicate dehydration affecting the kidneys, or potentially early kidney disease.

Her alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is also slightly elevated, which can be related to various causes including dehydration or liver stress.

Her platelet count is on the low side, which can sometimes be seen with inflammation or certain conditions.

**Alex Morgan:** That sounds concerning. What does this mean?

**Dr. Chen:** The elevated kidney values are the main concern. Given Daisy's symptoms - vomiting, decreased appetite, and the dehydration I saw - this could be primarily due to dehydration. When a dog is dehydrated, the kidneys work harder and these values can go up. However, we need to make sure this isn't something more chronic.

**Alex Morgan:** What should we do?

**Dr. Chen:** Here's my recommendation:

1. **Immediate care:** I want you to encourage Daisy to drink water. You can try adding a little low-sodium chicken broth to make it more appealing. If she's not drinking enough, we may need to bring her in for subcutaneous fluids to help rehydrate her.

2. **Diet:** For the next few days, offer her a bland diet - boiled chicken and rice, or a prescription gastrointestinal diet if you have it. Small, frequent meals are better than large meals right now.

3. **Monitoring:** Watch for continued vomiting. If she vomits more than once or twice in the next 24 hours, or if she becomes more lethargic, call us immediately or bring her to the emergency clinic.

4. **Follow-up:** I'd like to see Daisy back in 3-5 days to recheck her kidney values. If they come down with rehydration, that's a good sign it was primarily dehydration-related. If they stay elevated, we'll need to investigate further for possible kidney disease.

5. **Medication:** I'm going to prescribe an anti-nausea medication to help with the vomiting, and we'll start that today.

**Alex Morgan:** Okay, I'll do all of that. Should I be worried?

**Dr. Chen:** I think we caught this early, which is good. The fact that her symptoms started just two days ago suggests this is likely acute rather than chronic. The dehydration is treatable, and many dogs bounce back quickly once we get them rehydrated. The follow-up bloodwork will tell us more. For now, focus on getting her to drink and eat small amounts, and give her the medication as directed.

**Alex Morgan:** Thank you, Dr. Chen. I'll watch her closely.

**Dr. Chen:** You're welcome. Call us if you have any concerns or if her condition changes. We're here to help.

## Discharge Instructions Summary

- **Hydration:** Encourage water intake; may add low-sodium chicken broth. Monitor for signs of continued dehydration (dry gums, lethargy, decreased skin elasticity).
- **Diet:** Bland diet (boiled chicken and rice) in small, frequent meals. Avoid regular dog food for 2-3 days.
- **Medication:** Administer anti-nausea medication as prescribed.
- **Monitoring:** Watch for persistent vomiting, increased lethargy, or refusal to drink. Contact clinic if symptoms worsen.
- **Follow-up:** Recheck appointment scheduled for 3-5 days to repeat chemistry panel and assess kidney function improvement.
- **Emergency:** If Daisy becomes more lethargic, continues vomiting frequently, or refuses all food and water, seek immediate veterinary care.

## Notes for Medical Record

Patient presented with acute onset of vomiting, lethargy, and decreased appetite of 2 days duration. Physical examination revealed mild dehydration (tacky gums, slight weight loss). Diagnostic testing showed:
- Elevated WBC and neutrophils (inflammatory response)
- Elevated BUN (32) and Creatinine (1.8) - possible dehydration-related or early kidney disease
- Elevated ALP (liver enzyme)
- Low platelet count

Treatment plan: Supportive care with rehydration, bland diet, anti-nausea medication, and close monitoring. Follow-up bloodwork in 3-5 days to assess kidney function and rule out chronic kidney disease.

Prognosis: Guarded to good, pending response to rehydration and follow-up diagnostics.
